# foggy
an experimental prototype for fog computing. focus on service-centric networking.
the platform currently focuses on unikernel technology.

Major components:

1. Cache - incorporate different caching logic e.g., LRU, LFU.
2. Broker - incorportate different synchoronisation mechanisms.
3. Service - abstration of services, transparent to differnt virtualisation technologies.

Development plan:

2015.08 - implement the communication channel.
2015.09 - implement the service abstraction.
2015.10 - glue the component together and make the system run.
2015.11 - finlise the coding, and writing up the techreport.
